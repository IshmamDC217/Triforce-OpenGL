# Triforce-OpenGL

### Tools Utilized:
1. QT Creator
2. OpenGL

### Introduction
Qt Creator is an excellent development environment for OpenGL graphics. It provides a wide range of tools for creating, editing, and debugging applications with OpenGL support. It also offers an integrated OpenGL Shader Designer, which allows you to create and customize your own vertex and fragment shaders. Qt Creator also offers an integrated Qt Quick Designer, which allows you to quickly create user interfaces for your OpenGL applications. With Qt Creator, you can be sure that your OpenGL application will be cross-platform and will run on all major operating systems.

This project involved creating a 3D Triforce Emblem inspired by the Legend of Zelda game series. Utilizing classic OpenGL and C++ language, the entire project was created within the QT Creator environment.

The object consists of lighting and shaders, with QSliders available for users to adjust the lighting and angles of the object.
