### Introduction
Qt is a free and open-source widget toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces as well as cross-platform applications that run on various software and hardware platforms with minimal to no changes in the underlying codebase.

This project involved creating a 3D Triforce Emblem inspired by the Legend of Zelda game series. Utilizing classic OpenGL and C++ language, the entire project was created within the QT Creator environment.

The object consists of lighting and shaders, with QSliders available for users to adjust the lighting and angles of the object.
